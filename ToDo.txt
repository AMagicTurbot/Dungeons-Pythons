Create standard Creature Actions: Dodge
create a game blit to show health bars
add a cleanup step (del ) before instanciating new object to optimize memory

Idea: create token variables to store actions as:
    BeginTurnActions = []
    ActiveTurnActions = [] (replacing buttons.ActivePlayerActions)
    EndTurnActions = []
then the game.next_turn() method can call the action.do() method on turn change at the correct moment,
while game events (maily other actions) can add/remove actions from the 3 TurnActions lists.
